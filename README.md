Jumbline
========

A rendition of the game Jumbline (iOS &amp; Android) coded in MIPS Assembly code


Welcome everyone! this is an ongoing that will span the spring semester of 2014.
Our goal is to create a simplified version of the game Jumbline 2.
We are a team of four that has little experience in assembly language.
Thankfully we have the entire internet at our disposal so it shoudn't be too hard.
Below you will find a general changelog for large version changes.
Smaller updates will most likely be found with the appropriate subfolders (subject to change).


Hellllooo: Grant!
